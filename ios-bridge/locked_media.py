"""Reading inside Lumisound-locked (`.lms`) cloud tracks.

A locked file is the iOS app's own container: an 8-byte `LMSLOCK1` magic header
followed by the real audio XOR-masked with a fixed 24-byte key. To anything that
expects audio — ffmpeg, ffprobe, mutagen, AVFoundation — those bytes are noise.
That single fact is behind a whole family of "the server can't see it" problems:

  * artwork could only come from a thumbnail the phone uploaded separately,
    because the server could not read the cover embedded in the file;
  * `bpm` was only ever filled in by on-device analysis on the iPhone, so a
    library filled from tvOS or from cloud backup had it for almost nothing —
    which is what left Smart Playlists with nothing to build from.

This module gives the server the same read access the clients have.

**It never modifies a stored file.** The obvious reading of "unlock it, extract,
then lock it again" is to unmask the file in place and re-mask it afterwards,
and that is a genuinely dangerous way to do it: a crash, a restart or a full disk
between the two halves leaves the user's only copy in a state that matches
neither what the server expects nor what the client expects. Instead the masked
bytes are streamed into a temporary file, read from there, and the temporary file
is deleted — the original is opened read-only and is never rewritten, so there is
no window in which it can be left wrong. The net effect is the same and the
failure mode is "we learn nothing this time" instead of "the track is corrupt".

# Auto EQ picked a preset from the genre TAG, falling back to a tempo band. Both
# are metadata, and neither describes how a track sounds. A genre string is
# frequently absent or wrong on a downloaded track, and two songs sharing one are
# routinely mastered nothing alike; tempo says even less — it is a rate, not a
# tonal balance. So the chosen curve had no relationship to whether a track was
# already bass-heavy (where a bass boost makes it muddy) or genuinely thin.

# This measures the thing the decision needs: average energy in the same ten
# bands the equaliser has, expressed in dB RELATIVE to the track's own broadband
# level. Relative rather than absolute so the figure describes tonal balance
# rather than how loud the track was mastered — two masters of the same song at
# different levels should read as the same shape, because for EQ purposes they
# are.
