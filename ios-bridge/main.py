# Each yt-dlp invocation (plus its ffmpeg post-processing for format conversion)
# can hold 50-150MB RSS. The container is capped at 512MB (deploy.resources.limits
# in docker-compose.yml), and the host is itself memory-constrained. At 10 the
# combined peak regularly exceeded the cgroup limit and the kernel OOM-killer was
# killing the uvicorn process itself (visible in `journalctl -k` as
# "Memory cgroup out of memory: Killed process ... (uvicorn)"), taking the whole
# bridge down until the watchdog restarted it ~5 min later and causing a burst of
# "HTTP 502" download failures for every in-flight request. Lower this instead of
# the memory limit — the iOS client's "Download All" already queues more requests
# than this and just waits its turn.
#
# 2026-08: dropped 4 -> 2 after the same symptom recurred — this HOST (not
# just this container) runs 15+ other 512MB-capped containers (Discord music
# bots, Lavalink, etc.) on a single 7GB box that was observed with swap
# nearly full and steady swap-in/out traffic even at rest. Raising this
# container's own cgroup limit wouldn't help (the host has no spare RAM to
# grant it) and risks destabilizing the other co-located services instead;
# halving peak concurrent yt-dlp+ffmpeg+aria2+deno subprocess count is the
# lever that's actually available here, same as the original 10->4 cut.
#
# IMPORTANT: this cap bounds concurrent *processes* (RAM pressure on a
# shared host), not per-download *bandwidth* — a faster upstream connection
# (fiber, etc.) doesn't relax the constraint that made this get cut in the
# first place, it only means each already-running download finishes faster.
# The lever that actually spends extra bandwidth safely (more parallel
# connections *within* each already-running yt-dlp/aria2 process, not more
# whole processes) is `concurrent_fragments`/`-N` below — raised as part of
# this same pass. Still exposed as YTDLP_MAX_CONCURRENT so this can be tuned

# =none avoids a slow pre-allocate on the temp file. This is the single
# biggest download-speed win available here (the built-in downloader is
# single-connection). aria2c is installed in the Docker image.
#
# -k (min-split-size) is 1M rather than aria2's 20M default: a typical music
# track is only 3-8MB, so the 20M default would never split at all. 1M is
# aria2's OWN HARD MINIMUM for this option (aria2 rejects anything below
# 1048576 with "min-split-size must be between 1048576 and 1073741824" and
# exits immediately) — this used to be set to 256K, which is below that
# floor, so EVERY aria2 attempt failed outright with an option-validation
# error before opening a single connection. That failure was silently eaten
# by the 3-attempt retry loop's fallback to the native downloader, so
# aria2=true has never actually run a single real aria2 download in this
# deployment; every download that opted in just burned 2 full failed
# attempts before falling through. 1M gives a 3-8MB track real (if modest,
# ~3-8 way) parallelism instead of zero. retry-wait/max-tries give aria2 its
# own quick retry instead of failing the whole yt-dlp attempt on one flaky
# connection.

# --socket-timeout bounds a single stalled connection attempt instead of
# silently eating the whole per-call timeout further up the stack.
# A prior version of this pinned an explicit multi-client fallback
# (`youtube:player_client=tv,web_safari,ios,android_vr`) to work around
# yt-dlp/yt-dlp#16150 (android_vr occasionally returning only itag 18).
# That backfired: an EXPLICIT player_client list makes yt-dlp query every
# listed client's player API up front to build the merged formats list —
# it does not stop at the first client that works — so every single
# download paid for 3-4x the network round-trips it actually needed.
# Verified directly against this deployment's own failures: a real
# "Portal Soundtrack" track that was timing out at 140s with the 4-client
# list (all 4 concurrent download slots timing out together — consistent
# with the shared POT provider/network getting hammered by 4x the normal
# request volume) downloaded correctly in ~3s with android_vr alone,
# which also correctly returned proper adaptive audio formats (not the
# itag-18-only failure mode) for the Topic-channel video that motivated
# the original change. Left at yt-dlp's own default client selection —
# still not the same as before bd3ab019 (that commit's actual fix, the

# AVPlayer, and reported a track that simply never played. The POT provider
# was already running and healthy — nothing was asking it for a token.

    request routinely has no X-Account-Token at all. There's no account
    here to be "too new" — treating None as ineligible broke tvOS
    streaming outright (every such call fell through to zero cookies
    instead of the global session, which is an outright regression, not a
    tightened guardrail) the first time this shipped. The actual abuse
    case this function exists for — a throwaway ACCOUNT — is still fully

#
# "best" belongs in this set too, despite looking like a plain remux: per
# _download_format_args, "best" also uses `-x` (just without --audio-format),
# because raw `bestaudio` is frequently a .webm/opus stream — exactly what
# "best" is supposed to prefer. yt-dlp's `-x` there extracts to whatever
# native codec results (m4a/opus/ogg), not a guaranteed m4a container. The
# relay path can't replicate that: it streams whatever _get_raw_url resolves
# for "bestaudio/best" verbatim and mislabels it "{title}.m4a" regardless of
# the real container. On-device, AVFoundation can't demux webm/opus at all,
# so AudioTagWriter/isValidAudioFile correctly reject the result and the
# client falls back to the job-based flow anyway — but only after wasting a
# full download of the (often several-MB) opus file first. Every user with
# "Best Quality" selected would eat that tax on every single download, so
# "best" is excluded here entirely. Only m4a (near-universally available as
# YouTube's native itag 140, no transcode) is safe to relay raw.

    already has (matched by the embedded "<source>:<id>", regardless of filename
    or which playlist it came from) — the missing "tell yt-dlp what's there"
    piece — while re-downloading anything they've since deleted (it drops out of
    the rebuilt archive). yt-dlp also appends each newly-downloaded id to this

    Archive line format matches yt-dlp's own: "<extractor> <id>", e.g.

    recognized). This archive only backs `/api/download/batch`, which has

# metadata-resolve endpoint above uses — instead of a structured pick, it
# asks Aria Lumi for one short spoken transition line between two tracks,
# which the client speaks aloud (AVSpeechSynthesizer, entirely on-device)
# during the crossfade gap when AI DJ Mode is on. Deliberately uncached
# (each transition should feel fresh, unlike a metadata pick which is the
# same answer every time for the same inputs) and, like every other Aria
# Lumi task, a null/failed result just means the client skips the spoken
# intro for that transition and plays on as normal.

# alone already hits Gemini's rate limit a meaningful fraction of the time
# (confirmed via ios_app_event_log's analysis_rate_limited events); adding
# an unbounded-frequency AI feature on top of that would only make it
# worse. Even when the Gemini call itself is rate-limited, a deterministic
# fallback pick is still cached for the day, so the shelf never comes up

    `played_at` before every DATE()/HOUR() grouping so streaks and the

# =============================================================================
# SOCIAL ECOSYSTEM (profiles, friends, presence) — 2026-07-18
#
# Greenfield feature: public profiles with two-tone accent customization,
# pinned favorite tracks, a friends system (request/accept/decline/remove +
# block), lightweight polling-based online/offline + now-playing presence,
# a friends-only activity feed, and mutual-friend suggestions.
#
# Everything here is deliberately self-contained and namespaced:
#   - Tables:   ios_social_* / ios_presence_* (schema.sql, additive only)
#   - Routes:   /api/social/* (distinct from the pre-existing global,
#               non-friend-scoped /social/* activity+discover feed above)
#   - Auth:     reuses get_current_user (JWT + session-revocation check)
#               exactly like every other authenticated endpoint in this file
#               — no changes to auth.py.
#
# This section does not alter or drop any existing table/column; it only
# adds new ones and, separately, extends the /user/avatar endpoints above
# in place to also accept GIF bytes (see _is_gif_bytes).

# launch/foreground and every 8-minute tick (see AccountService+Sync.swift's
# own comment). This hub gives the bridge a way to push a small, specific
# "X changed" event to a connected client the instant it happens, so the
# client can do a targeted, incremental refetch of just that one thing
# instead of a blind interval-based full resync. Deliberately per-process,
# in-memory (not Redis/pub-sub) — this bridge already runs as a single
# process (see the rest of this file's in-memory job-tracking dicts, e.g.
# _BATCH_JOBS/_DOWNLOAD_JOBS/_LYRICS_JOBS), so a per-connection registry is
