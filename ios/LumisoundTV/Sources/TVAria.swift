// MARK: - Aria Lumi on tvOS
//
// Aria is the bridge's intelligence layer (ios-bridge/intelligence.py). On iOS
// she does a lot of things, and most of them do not belong on a television:
// metadata disambiguation, duplicate resolution and cloud cleanup all act on
// FILES, and tvOS owns no files — it streams someone else's library. Porting
// those would mean putting destructive, hard-to-review decisions behind a remote
// control, which is the wrong device for them.
//
// What is ported is what a 10-foot screen is actually good at:
//
//   * **Daily Pick** (`GET /user/aria/daily-pick`) — one track Aria chose out of
//     the library for today, with her reason for choosing it. Passive, needs no
//     input, and gives Home something that changes day to day.
//   * **DJ transitions** (`POST /user/ai-dj/transition`) — a one-line spoken
//     handover into the track that's starting. This is the piece that most
//     benefits from a television: it is the one Aria feature that is better
//     heard across a room than read on a phone.
//
// She is not switchable. The settings screen has no toggle for her by design —
// see `TVSettingsView`. That is also why nothing here has an "enabled" check: a
// disabled path that cannot be reached is a path that rots.
//
// NOTHING in this file touches the iOS app. Aria's iOS surface (AccountService+
// Intelligence, AriaActivityLog, AriaCloudCleanupService) is untouched; this
// calls the same HTTP endpoints independently, so tvOS cannot regress her
// behaviour on the phone.
