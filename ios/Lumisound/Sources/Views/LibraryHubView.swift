// MARK: - Library Hub
//
// The Library tab's new landing screen — a dashboard ("hub") of shortcuts to
// the user's real playlists/folders/favorites, plus a few auto-generated
// groupings, sitting above the traditional Songs/Artists/Albums/Folders/...
// browsing tabs (still fully reachable via `LibraryTabBar` — see
// `LibraryTab.hub`, which sits alongside them rather than replacing them).
//
// Loosely inspired by a YouTube-Music-style home screen (a "speed dial" grid
// of shortcut tiles + horizontal carousels of curated content), but
// reinterpreted around Lumisound's own data model rather than cloned:
//   - Speed dial tiles = real `Playlist`s, `MusicFolderService` local
//     folders, and Favorites (if non-empty) — never placeholder content.
//   - Carousels = `SmartPlaylistStore`'s auto-generated mixes (the app's own
//     "auto-generated grouping" concept — Recently Added / Most Played /
//     Forgotten Favorites / Quick Listens, plus anything the user made
//     themselves), a Recently Added shelf, an On Repeat (most played) shelf,
//     a Forgotten Favorites shelf, and a Moods shelf if `MoodPlaylistService`
//     has classified anything yet.
