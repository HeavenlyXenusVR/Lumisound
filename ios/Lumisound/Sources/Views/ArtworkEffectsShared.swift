// MARK: - ArtworkClock (wall-clock-driven ambient animation phases)

/// curve-repeat pattern relies on a Core Animation transaction staying alive
/// indefinitely — but `NowPlayingView` re-renders every 0.25–0.5s while
/// playing (`PlaybackProgress.position` ticks that often), and that frequent
/// re-rendering was observed to freeze `repeatForever` animations mid-cycle
/// across every Now Playing artwork style. Deriving the phase fresh from
/// `TimelineView`'s `context.date` on every redraw sidesteps the whole
/// problem: there's no in-flight animation to interrupt, just a value
/// recomputed from elapsed time. Every artwork style's `body` should be
/// wrapped in `TimelineView(.animation(minimumInterval: 1.0 / 60.0, paused: ...))`
/// and read phases via these helpers instead of animating `@State` directly.
/// The `minimumInterval` caps every style at 60fps regardless of the
/// device's native refresh rate — these are ambient background motion, not
/// anything that benefits from ProMotion's 120Hz, so the extra redraws were
/// pure CPU/GPU/battery cost with no visible difference. Same reasoning
/// `start8DRotation`/`startTremolo`/`startVibrato` already apply to their own
/// `CADisplayLink`s via `preferredFrameRateRange` — this is the `TimelineView`
/// equivalent of that same cap.
