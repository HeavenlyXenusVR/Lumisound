        // different IP) returned 403 and never produced a temp file to play. The

        // also extracts lazily (when the app fetches it), so Play is instant and

        // here. A download can be transcoded and re-tagged server-side; a live
        // stream hands bytes straight to AVFoundation, which cannot demux
        // several of the formats that setting offers — Opus resolves to a WebM
        // container and fails outright (AVErrorFileFormatNotRecognized, -11828).
        // The bridge already coerces those to m4a, but asking for the right
        // thing keeps both sides agreeing on what the bytes are: the temp file
        // this stream is written to takes its extension from the requested
        // format, so requesting opus and receiving AAC produced a `.opus` file
        // full of MP4 that AVAudioFile rejected as invalid ('dta?').
        //
        // m4a is YouTube's native itag 140 (AAC in MP4) — no transcode, and
        // natively playable. Non-YouTube sources keep the requested format,
