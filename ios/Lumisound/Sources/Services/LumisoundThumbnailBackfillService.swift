// MARK: - LumisoundThumbnailBackfillService
//
// One-time (per-track) backfill of pre-uploaded thumbnails for locked
// (.lms) cloud tracks that were uploaded before artwork-upload existed —
// see `StreamingService.uploadTrack`'s thumbnail-upload step and
// `/user/music/artwork-upload` in main.py. That fix only runs DURING a
// fresh upload; a track that was already sitting in the cloud library
// before it shipped has `has_artwork = true` in its metadata row (correctly
// recording that the ORIGINAL file had embedded art) but no actual
// thumbnail bytes ever got stored server-side for it — the server can't
// extract them itself from locked bytes, same limitation as ever. Every
// track uploaded before this feature existed would otherwise show no
// artwork forever, no matter how long the app runs, since nothing else
// ever revisits an already-completed upload.
