// MARK: - Stream tickets
//
// A short-lived credential the app puts in the QUERY STRING of a stream URL,
// because AVPlayer cannot be relied on to carry a header there.
//
// The player is handed the bridge's proxy URL and fetches it itself. Auth rides
// on `AVURLAsset`'s "AVURLAssetHTTPHeaderFieldsKey" option, which applies to the
// opening request and is not reliably reapplied to the byte-range requests that
// follow it. Telemetry settled this beyond argument: of every recorded proxy
// rejection carrying range information, 309 of 309 were RANGED requests and not
// one was unranged. So a track starts, plays for a moment, and dies the instant
// the player asks for its second range — reported as tracks that simply refuse
// to play, with a 404/-1100 in the log that pointed at the wrong thing entirely.
//
// A URL survives where a header does not, so the credential moves into the URL.
// Deliberately NOT the account token: query strings end up in server access logs
// and a session token has no business there. A ticket is opaque, carries nothing
// about the account on its face, is bound to the user server-side, and expires.
