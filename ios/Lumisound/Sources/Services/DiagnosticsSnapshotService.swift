//
// Periodic structured snapshot of live app state — playback, profile, the
// social system, and which settings are actually on AND having a visible
// effect — sent to the bridge's event log every `interval`. This exists
// specifically because there's no Xcode/device debugger available in this
// project's dev environment: every prior investigation (the gallery
// background stuck-icon bug, the Library reload freeze, the media scan
// stutter) started from either a lucky log line or an ad-hoc one-off dump
// added mid-investigation. This is the standing version of that same idea —
// a routine, always-on "what does a real session actually look like right
// now" readout, so the next investigation starts with data already in hand
// instead of needing its own round of diagnostic builds first.
//
// Always-on, no settings toggle — matches PerformanceMonitorService's own
// "just always runs" precedent for infrastructure-level diagnostics (that
// one covers CPU/GPU; this one covers app-level state). Skips entirely
// while backgrounded (nothing meaningful changes for a user who isn't
// looking at the app, and there's no reason to spend the network/battery).
