// MARK: - LumisoundTrackVaultService
//
// Drives the "reinject encrypted Lumisound metadata into every track, then
// re-encode it into the Lumisound-exclusive format" pipeline, for the WHOLE
// local library — downloaded tracks and plain local imports alike (widened
// 2026-08; previously local imports were skipped entirely and could never
// get re-encoded):
//  1. Tags newly-completed downloads immediately (`tagNewDownload`, called
//     right after a file lands on disk — see StreamingService+DownloadToLibrary).
//  2. Backfills the rest of the existing library — including tracks the
//     user imported locally rather than downloaded through the app — in
//     small batches via a `BGProcessingTask` (longer-running/lower-priority
//     than `BackgroundRefreshService`'s `BGAppRefreshTask`, appropriate for
//     a bulk one-time-per-track sweep rather than a periodic check), plus
//     an in-app fallback pass so the backfill also makes progress for users
//     who rarely background the app long enough for BGProcessingTask to
//     fire — the same real-world caveat BackgroundRefreshService documents:
//     iOS, not this code, decides if/when a submitted request actually runs.
//  3. Every 5 minutes in the foreground (`startFiveMinuteForegroundLoop`),
//     plus whenever the BGProcessingTask above actually gets to run, forces
//     a fresh sweep for anything tagged-but-not-yet-converted and re-encodes
//     it (`runExtensionConversionPass`) — so a track that failed to convert
//     on an earlier pass, or was just tagged by the backfill above, doesn't
//     have to wait indefinitely.
