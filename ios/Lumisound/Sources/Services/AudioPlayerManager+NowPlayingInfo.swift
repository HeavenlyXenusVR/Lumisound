    /// only writes when the system's picture would otherwise be wrong. It used
    /// to rewrite the whole dictionary twice a second, which fits both lock

    ///
    ///   * Seeking from the lock screen did not take: each rewrite reset the
    ///     elapsed time while the scrubber was being dragged.
    ///   * Pause looked ignored: the system shows the paused state
    ///     optimistically, and a tick landing around the command could
    ///     re-assert a playback rate of 1.
    ///
    /// The system extrapolates elapsed time from the rate on its own, which is
    /// what Apple documents this property pair for. Republishing is only needed
    /// when the track, rate or duration changes, or when real playback has
    /// drifted from that extrapolation (a seek, a stall, a slow start). Each
    /// write is also a cross-process call into the media daemon, so cutting
    /// two a second to a handful a track is a battery saving in its own right.
