// MARK: - SpectralEQMatcher
//
// Picks an EQ preset by measuring the track, instead of guessing from its tags.
//
// Auto EQ chose from the genre STRING, falling back to a tempo band. Both are
// metadata and neither describes how a track sounds. A genre tag is frequently
// missing or wrong on a downloaded track, two songs sharing one are routinely
// mastered nothing alike, and tempo says even less — it is a rate, not a tonal
// balance. So the chosen curve bore no relationship to whether a track was
// already bass-heavy (where a bass boost only makes it muddy) or genuinely thin.
//
// The server now measures each track's average energy in the same ten bands the
// equaliser has, relative to that track's own overall level — a tonal
// fingerprint. Selection becomes a question with a real answer: which preset,
// applied to THIS track, brings it closest to the target?
//
// The target is the median shape of the user's own library, supplied by the
// server. That makes Auto EQ a consistency control — "make this track sit like
// the typical track you own" — rather than an outside opinion imposed on a
// collection that is mostly game and anime scores. It is also self-calibrating:
// a library of loud remixes and one of quiet piano end up with different
// targets without anyone having to choose one.
//
// Measured on a real cloud library: 11 tracks in 28 are already close enough to
// the target that the honest answer is no EQ at all, and the remainder reduce
// their deviation from it by 11% to 77%.
