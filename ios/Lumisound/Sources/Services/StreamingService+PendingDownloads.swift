// MARK: - Pending Downloads (background-completed downloads reconciliation)
//
// The job-based /api/download flow (see StreamingService+DownloadToLibrary.swift)
// already runs entirely server-side once started — yt-dlp keeps going even if
// the app is backgrounded or killed mid-poll. What this file adds is the other
// half: recovering a finished download the app never got to fetch, because the
// bridge now durably holds it (GET /api/download/pending) instead of deleting
// it after 15 minutes. Reconciliation is called from several trigger points
// (app launch, app-foreground, each BGAppRefreshTask run, and immediately on a
// "download_ready" silent push — see AppDelegate and BackgroundRefreshService)
// so a download that finishes while the app isn't open still lands in the
// library on its own, without the user needing to notice anything.
//
// Those trigger points genuinely overlap in practice — a normal "reopen the
// app" fires BOTH the launch `.task` AND the scenePhase == .active handler
// close together, and each independently lists /api/download/pending and
// tries to fetch the same job_id. /api/download/result deletes its durable
// copy after being served once, so whichever call wins gets 200 and the
// other gets 404 — confirmed in production logs as repeated 200-then-404
// pairs for the same job_id. That race was harmless on its own (the winner
// still imports correctly) but wasteful and, combined with zero logging on
// that specific failure branch, impossible to diagnose from the field. The
// gate below collapses concurrent calls into a single in-flight fetch so
// there's only ever one claimant per reconciliation pass.
