    // SUPPORTED_AUDIO_EXTS doesn't recognize) will never succeed no matter how
    // many times it's retried — but `pending` is recomputed from scratch on
    // EVERY scan (LibraryView's onAppear/refresh, folder-watch, foreground
    // return, ...), so without this a single permanently-unbackupable track
    // silently burned a real network request every single scan, forever.
    // Confirmed in production logs: one locally-imported track logged 1900+
    // "upload failed ... HTTP 400" retries in a week. Keyed by filename+size
    // (not just filename) so replacing the file with different content — the
    // one case where a retry could actually succeed — gets a fresh attempt.
    // Bumped v1 -> v2 to discard the memo built up against a server bug that
    // has since been fixed: `/user/music/upload` mangled any filename whose
    // base name ended with a period (a title like "Super Smash Bros." backs up
    // as "...Bros..opus.lms", whose ".." the server collapsed, destroying the
    // extension) and 400'd it. Those tracks are genuinely uploadable now, but
    // this guard had already recorded them as permanently failed — so without
    // resetting the key they'd stay skipped forever and silently never back
    // up, which is the exact failure this guard exists to bound, not cause.
    // Any entry still genuinely unbackupable just re-earns its 3 strikes.
