/// request actually runs. It won't fire before `earliestBeginDate`, and past
/// that the OS schedules it based on the device's usage patterns, battery
/// level, and network state; there is no guaranteed cadence, and it may not
/// run for long stretches if the app isn't opened often. This can't be
/// verified from a dev machine with no physical device — if a user reports
/// subscriptions never update in the background, that's the first thing to
/// suspect (and "Check Now" always still works as a manual fallback).
