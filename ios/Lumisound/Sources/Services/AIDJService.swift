/// AI DJ Mode — when enabled, briefly ducks playback volume after each
/// track change and speaks a short Aria Lumi-written transition line
/// on-device (AVSpeechSynthesizer), then restores volume and lets playback
/// continue as normal. The transition text itself comes from the bridge's
/// POST /user/ai-dj/transition (same `call_intelligence`/Gemini pipeline
/// Aria Lumi's metadata matching uses — see intelligence.py) so it stays
/// server-side and never needs an on-device model; only the speaking
/// happens locally, same reasoning as everywhere else in the app that
/// avoids sending audio anywhere.
///
/// Deliberately narrow in scope: this reacts to `AudioPlayerManager`
/// finishing a track change, the same signal `NowPlayingView` etc. already
/// observe, rather than reaching into the crossfade engine itself — no
/// changes to `AudioPlayerManager+Crossfade.swift`'s actual mixing logic.
/// Volume ducking reuses `audioSettings.volume`, the exact same knob
/// `SleepTimerService`'s fade-out already drives (see that type's
/// `getVolume`/`setVolume` closures, wired the same way from
/// `LumisoundApp.swift`), so the two features can never fight over two
/// different volume paths.
